  A blog about security, CTF, vulnerabilities, pen-testing and other
  interesting things that are related to security. Mostly writeups from
  results of challenges, war-games, hacking into local vulnerable VM's
  and similar. I will try to make the writeups as realistic as possible
  by including all my wrong assumptions and failures. Also I will try
  to not include code complete walkthroughs, but leave the actual coding
  as an excercise to the reader.
